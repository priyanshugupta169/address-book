# Address Book Application

This is a simple address book application built with FastAPI and Docker Compose. It allows users to create, update, delete, and retrieve addresses, as well as find addresses within a given distance based on location coordinates.


## Installation

Before running the application, ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

### Docker Installation

To install Docker, follow the instructions for your specific operating system:
- [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/)
- [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/)
- [Docker Engine for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

### Docker Compose Installation

Docker Compose usually comes bundled with Docker Desktop installation for Windows and Mac. For Linux, you might need to install it separately:
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Features

1. **CRUD Operations:**
   - Users can create, read, update, and delete addresses.
   - Endpoints are provided for adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting addresses.

2. **Address Retrieval:**
   - Users can retrieve addresses by ID.
   - Endpoints are available to fetch address details based on the provided address ID.

3. **Find Addresses within Distance:**
   - Users can search for addresses within a specified distance from a given location.
   - An endpoint is provided to find addresses within a specified distance based on latitude and longitude.

4. **API Documentation:**
   - Interactive API documentation provided by FastAPI for easy testing and reference.
   - Users can access detailed documentation of all available endpoints at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

5. **Data Validation:**
   - Data validation is implemented using Pydantic models.
   - Pydantic models ensure that incoming data is properly validated before processing.

6. **Error Handling:**
   - Proper error handling is implemented for invalid requests.
   - Users receive meaningful error messages for any invalid requests or server-side errors encountered during API interactions.


## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/address-book.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd address-book
    ```

3. Build and start the Docker containers:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

4. Access the FastAPI application at `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.

## API Documentation

Once the application is running, you can view the API documentation generated by FastAPI at `http://localhost:8000/docs`. This interactive documentation provides details about available endpoints and allows you to test them directly from the browser.

## Running Unit Tests

To run unit tests for the address book application, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the Docker containers are running:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. Open a new terminal window/tab and navigate to the address-book directory.

3. Run the following command to execute the unit tests:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec app python -m pytest tests/test.py
   ```
This command will run all the unit tests defined in the tests/test.py file and provide the test results.

## Features

1. **Endpoints:**
   - Add a new book (title, author, publication year).
   - Submit a review for a book (text review, rating).
   - Retrieve all books with an option to filter by author or publication year.
   - Retrieve all reviews for a specific book.

2. **Data Validation:**
   - Data validation is implemented using Pydantic models.

3. **Documentation:**
   - Comments have been added to the code for better understanding.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Proper error handling is implemented for invalid requests.


## Database Integration

This project currently uses SQLite as the database backend. The database integration and schema design are implemented in the 
`db.py`, `models.py`, and `schemas.py` files.

## Testing

1. **Testing:**
   - Tests for the API endpoints can be written using FastAPI's test client.
